## Acknowledging Sources

You **must** always properly acknowledge the sources you used and people you worked with.

## Instructor rights

The instructors reserve the right to give you an exam (oral, written, or both) to determine the degree that you participated in the making of the coursework, and how well you understand what was submitted. For example, you may be asked to explain any code that was submitted and why you choose to write it that way. This may impact the mark that you receive for the work. So, whenever you submit work, especially if you collaborate, you should be prepared for an individual inspection/walkthrough in which you explain what every line of the work does and why you choose to write it that way.

The student grants the instructors the perpetual right to run plagiarism-detection tools on any part of your solution, even beyond the duration of the course.

## Copyright

The student retains the copyright of the work `student name`.

## Redistribution is forbidden

This software cannot be redistributed under any circumstances, whether by the original student or by a third party. If this software is found in any public website or public repository, the person finding it is kindly requested to immediately report, including the URL or other repository locating information.

The student acknowledges that if any portion of this software is included in a solution submitted for grading by someone else at any educational institution, the student and the other submitter are subject to sanctions for plagiarism.
